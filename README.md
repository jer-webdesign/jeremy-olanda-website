2. Create an email template (use variables: `from_name`, `from_email`, `message`, `to_name`, `to_email`, `reply_to`).
3. Add your EmailJS credentials to your `.env` file:
   ```env
   VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
   VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
   VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
   ```
4. The contact form will send submissions to your email. No auto-reply is sent to the visitor.

# Vercel Deployment

1. Push your code to GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket).
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and import your project.
3. Set the following build settings (auto-detected for Vite):
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
4. Add your environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
   - `VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`
   - `VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID`
   - `VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`
5. Deploy and get your live URL!

# Data Source

- All portfolio content is loaded from `public/developer.json`.
- To update your profile, projects, blog posts, or skills, just edit this JSON file.

---

# API Integration (Legacy/Optional)

- The app can still be configured to use a backend API by setting `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in your `.env` file.
- If the API is unavailable, fallback mock data is used.

## API Integration (Legacy/Optional)

The frontend can optionally connect to a backend API if you set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in your `.env` file. By default, all data is loaded from `public/developer.json` and no backend is required.

### API Endpoints (if using a backend)

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/profile` | GET | Fetch developer profile data |
| `/projects` | GET | Fetch all projects |
| `/posts` | GET | Fetch all blog posts |
| `/contact` | POST | Submit contact form |

If the API is unavailable, the app will display fallback mock data.
