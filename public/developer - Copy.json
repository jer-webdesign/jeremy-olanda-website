    "title": "About Me",
    "content": "I'm Jeremy Olanda, a software engineer with professional experience spanning firmware development, enterprise software engineering, Python automation, and modern web development. My career has taken me from developing firmware for hard disk drives at Fujitsu and Seagate Technology to building educational technology solutions at KooBits Learning, and now mastering cutting-edge web frameworks at Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. What drives me is solving complex technical problems that create real business value. Whether I'm saving companies $100K through strategic optimization, developing proprietary patents for data storage technology, or building secure web applications, I bring the same commitment to excellence and innovation that has earned me industry recognition including Seagate's Asian GM Award. I thrive on the intersection of deep technical expertise and practical solutions—combining my extensive background in low-level systems programming (C/C++, embedded firmware) with modern web technologies (React, Node.js, Python Flask) to architect robust, scalable applications.
